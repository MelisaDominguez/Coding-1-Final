# Coding-1-Final
 These are the starter files for F2020 Coding 1


The home page in pretty basic. First the Navbar, it has the code for the buttons and then 
the words in the buttons are in the ul "nav navbar-nav navbar-right". The buttons are linked 
to the designated place. They have a class called "navtext", that adds the font-color, font-style,
and font-family.
Next is the corousel section, it first has the code that makes it function, then
the images that are used in it. The img tags are styled in style,css to fit the page. 
After that, is the footer. It's basic and simple. The h2 "footertitle", lets the viewer
know that the information in the footer are quick links. The a href in the actual "footerinfo"
has the link to github where the file to the code is found. The footer title is styled in stylecss
to make it center, change to a purple font-color, and have a different font style. The footerinfo in css
makes the actual link whiter and takes away the line under it with text-decoration: none. The .footer 
in style.css adds a black backgound to the footer and fixes its height. 
The aboutme page has the same footer and navbar as the home page. The only difference is the image 
added and the information there. The aboutme img is fixed in style.css to fit the weboage. And the 
information in the p tag has the paragraph about me. In style.css, the paragraph is centered, and styled
to fit the webpage. 
The contactme page, also has the same navbar and footer as the homepage and aboutme page. It has my contact
information in the p class="contactinfo". Its styled to be a color black and have a font size of 20px in 
style.css. In the accual information, my email and phone number have a br to make the information after it 
go to another line.
